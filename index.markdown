# Welcome!

I'm [Ismael Correa Castro](https://github.com/Iarfen/), I'm a scientist and this website presents my inventions, the ones which I've decided to make public.

I've created a wide amount of inventions, among the better of them is the **Bioeditor**, also called **DNA Editor**, which is a program that allows to edit all the genome of a life form and create then new life forms, a 3d file format very lightweight called **L3D**, a file format for creating digital worlds called **DWML**, a **role materializer**, which is a technology that creates RPG games in real life.

## My scientific career

I've studied deeply **informatics**, **chemistry** and **biology**. I know about physics, but not as much as those other areas.

What I've done to study informatics is to read all the documentation of the development technologies important to use, as are programming languages, frameworks and libraries.

To study chemistry and biology I've read a big amount of big books, that's, books of more than 1000 pages. The most important of them have been the following, you can study some or all of them if you want to know science as me:

- "Chemistry: The central science", by Theodore Brown, H. LeMay, Bruce Bursten, Catherine Murphy, Patrick Woodward, Matthew Stoltzfus.
- "Organic chemistry", by T. W. Graham Solomons, Craig B. Fryhle, Scott A. Snyder.
- "Understanding nutrition", by Ellie Whitney, Sharon Rady Rolfes.
- "Genetics: Analysis and principles", by Robert Brooker.
- "Biochemistry", by Donald Voet, Judith G. Voet.
- "Molecular biology of the cell", by Bruce Alberts, Rebecca Heald, Alexander Johnson.

I've read more big books, and also some big books of physics, but those are the most important ones and then are the ones I prefer to refer to everyone, because I think they are really important books.

## My engineering career

I work as **engineer** during labour hours, as software developer. As software developer I can learn which technologies are being used inside companies and then I can think of which improvements are important to do inside programming libraries.

## Start of my scientific career

I started learning science since my childhood, watching **Dexter's Laboratory** I've become interested on science. During those years, when I was less than 10 years old, I was thinking when watching that series how were scientific inventions made, without understanding how to do any of them.

When I was 10 years old I've developed my first website, called **Planeta Pok√©mon**. I've learned then a good amount of informatics by developing that website, during 3 years. During those years I've learned how to program in C, which has been my first programming language.

After that I've started learning how to program videogames, I've started with RPG Maker XP. Of that game engine I've understood all the internal code that was available to read, and I've learned then how to create graphical user interfaces natively, how to program listeners of events, among a wide amount of important topics. I've learned, then, by developing videogames, a good amount about software architecture. I've learned, in fact, the design patterns, the native behavior of all kinds of applications (videogames, websites and desktop applications), among other important programming topics.

In **2007**, given these previous experiences programming, I've created a physics engine and a big part of a game engine. Those same months I've had the idea, given the fact that I was already knowing a big amount of informatics, to create scientific inventions. Then, thinking on it, I've created the **DNA Editor**, it was february of 2007, a night where I was dreaming about science, and I was thinking about genetics combinations. In that dream, I've had various ideas about how DNA could be changed to create new life forms, and then the DNA Editor has logically appeared as a tool to edit DNA without mistakes with the edition of nucleotides.

That same month, after the DNA Editor, I've thinked about the digital world of the series Digimon Adventure, which appears also in other series in other forms. Essentially, a digital world is a world existing by digital means, rather than by material means. I've thinked that it's possible to create digital worlds with a language similar to HTML, which I've called **DWML**, in order to have a digital world browser that allows to live in digital worlds. I've thinked the digital worlds as each one being totally independent to the others and, so, some can be like a videogame, others can be similar to parts of the city in real life but in digital form, and others can be just fantasy places.

With DWML I've created **L3D**. L3D is a file format of 3d models very lightweight, which allows to have 3d by consuming a low amount of computing resources. That makes it ideal for digital worlds because it was then possible to load a digital world by a network connection very fast, cause with L3D the 3d models just size some KB and no more. L3D can be used for any software that uses 3d, not only for digital worlds. Other applications of L3D are videogames and science simulators.

Some months later I've designed the **role materializer**. To design it means essentially to invent it, although it's needed to construct it to test it. The role materializer is an invention that, given a set of cubes with screen, it represents with them in real life the RPG that the rolemaster relates. For the NPCs robots that change in their exterior form can be used. Those robots were partially ready in that same period.

## About myself

I like a lot **videogames**, and also **music** and **entertainment** in general. During my childhood and my adolescence I was a **gamer**, apart from being a programmer. At the present, being an adult, I'm more a researcher besides other ways of living, although I continue playing videogames.

All my scientific inventions, which I think are important, **give merit** to the culture of videogames and to gamers in general in science, because I'm one of them.

I like science because it allows to **improve the world**, the difference it has with engineering is that inside science there're a big amount of possibilities that weren't possible years ago, the important discoveries that have happended in science have changed the technologies that humans can create.

## My objectives

As scientist I've the following objectives:

- Continue developing the **creational biology**, the **DNA Editor** (currently called **Bioeditor**), and related technologies.
- Enhance technologies for **personal laboratories**.
- Research and, if possible, cure **cancer**.
- Improve the research on **autonomous research centers** and **scientific communities**.

## My projects

The projects I've realized and that are then of my authorship are the following:

- **Bioeditor** (previously called **DNA Editor**)**:** A program that allows to edit all the genome of an organism to modify it, or to create new organisms based on that genome.
- **Creational biology:** Theories and ideas about the branch of biology which I've called creational biology, which deals about homunculous, which are animals created artificially.
- **L3D file format:** A very lightweight 3d file format, the lightest of the 3d file formats, and then I defend it as the better of them.
- **Role materializer:** It's a set of cubes with screen that stacked together can represent virtually any place or building. It allows to create RPGs in real life.
- **DWML file format:** A file format that allows to create digital worlds.
- **Science file formats:** Various file formats. **DNA** file format for storing DNA, **SMF** to represent molecules, **SFF** to represent food, **AMF** to represent matter.
- **Spaceships theories and ideas:** I've written various theories and ideas about spaceships.
- **CWD file format:** A file format to create new words and bywords.
- Among other projects, not yet released publicly.
